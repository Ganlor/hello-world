# hello-world
First repository

Hello,
I'm learning how to use github and it's associated tools as I learn how to code. I'm hoping to use this platform as a tool in my journy to learn and improve my coding, and ultimately to be able to make games. In the meantime, I'll be working on these tutorials.
